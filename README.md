# GeoVR - Urban Planning

## About
> study project in winter term 2016/17 at ifgi.

The goal of this study project was to built a Virtual Reality (VR) application which would facilitate the envisionment of urban planning for normal citizens. In particular it covers the "Hamannplatz" area in Muenster Coerde, Germany. To achieve this goal we used the web based VR framework [A-frame](https://aframe.io/).




## Technologies

ES6 & WebPack
a-frame                 WebVR framework
.dae & .obj Models      visuals of object templates
 openStreetMap data

## repo structure
This repository more or less follows the gitflow structure, without a develop branch.
So: build your features on separate branches, and pull request to `master` :^)

## Installation

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
