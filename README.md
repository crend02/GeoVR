# GeoVR - Urban Planning

> study project in winter term 2016/17 at ifgi.

WebVR based toolkit for citizens interested in urban planning.

## build instructions
If you have `node` installed, you can run a development server, which hosts the site on [`localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000)

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## repo structure
This repository more or less follows the gitflow structure, without a develop branch.
So: build your features on separate branches, and pull request to `master` :^)

## license
`?`
